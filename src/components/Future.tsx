      I believe in living in the present and making active decisions that shape
      our lives. However, I also understand the value of making abstract plans
      and embracing new opportunities. With that in mind, here's a glimpse of
      what I envision for the future:

      Exploring Opportunities Abroad

    <Text maxW={"600px"}>
      One of my aspirations is to gain international experience by working
      abroad. I am excited about the prospect of immersing myself in different
      cultures, collaborating with diverse teams, and broadening my professional
      horizons. I believe that working in a global context will not only expand
      my skills and knowledge but also provide me with valuable insights and
      perspectives.

      While I don't have a specific timeline or destination in mind at the
      moment, I am open to exploring opportunities that align with my interests
      and professional goals. I am eager to embrace new challenges, contribute
      my skills, and continue learning from a variety of experiences.

      As the future is ever-evolving, I approach it with an open mind and a
      willingness to adapt. I am excited to see where my journey takes me and to
      embrace the opportunities that come my way.
